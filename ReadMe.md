# Student Performance Prediction
This project aims to predict student performance using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various factors, the model provides insights into academic outcomes, helping educators and institutions make data-driven decisions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Implementation of multiple machine learning models.
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Visualization of results for better interpretability.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MLG382-Student-performance-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd MLG382-Student-performance-prediction
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run all the models
